Sign language recognition and translation system optimization

Goal:
To develop or improve data-based sign language recognition and real-time translation tools.

Details:
Using publicly available sign language data sets, machine learning models are trained to recognize sign language and translate it into text or speech.
Explore how to achieve cross-language translation between different sign languages (e.g. ASL, BSL).
Think about the diversity of sign language data and how to provide equitable support to users of different languages globally.

Use these images to train a classifier for the words or letters. Design a model to crop the hands out of the picture first, and then do classification.
