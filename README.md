# Final-Project
The steps for setting up the classification model will be:

Load dataset and do any kind of pre-processing
Split data into train/test datasets
Split independent features and classification label and load them into Tensors
Create DataLoader instances (we'll see what this means below)
Build a NN model
Set up an optimizer
Pick a cost/loss function
Implement an evaluation function and any other kind of visualization that helps quantify the model
Train model
Evaluate
